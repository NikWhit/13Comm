Description- 

This is a backend database for what could be an eCommerce platform that includes category, product, and tag information. 
utilizing sequelize run through the command hub, we're supposed to seed the data. However, my computer is getting pretty old and some of my drivers are expiring. 
I also lot the ability to run my git bash shell for NPM and everything else through my terminal because there was an update a little under a month ago that made my file PATH mess up completely. 

I utilized the module 13 ORM practices to rework to code to this point. A lot of reverse look ups, a lot of refining. 

Install -
run npm install or node server.js in the root.
