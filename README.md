# Product eCommerce Solution

Special thanks to the graders who were very specific in their critiques to help me identify where I was going wrong. 

And to my Tutors:
Special thanks to Sam Cordova and Justin Moore who helped me get my new machine loaded with the right programs to get this thing running after my last one would do nothing but crash. 

I want to give a very special thanks to Nick Rhodes who is my success manager, who is gracious enough to allow me more time after the hardships I've had to deal with during the time of the course. I wouldn't have been able to get this far without any of you. It is really appreciated. 

## Acknowledgement of Practicality 
2023 was a difficult year. Economic situations left me looking for more work multiple times and I want to say that the knowledge that is acquired not only in this course, but in particular through THIS assignment, are skills that are in high demand. 
The positions that pay adequately have requirements of knowledge of SQL and similar funtions. There have been a number of professional projects that I would've liked to have worked on in my career, but I was underqualified without more experience that I'm getting through this course. 
So, thank you.

## Description- 

This is a backend database for what could be an eCommerce platform that includes category, product, and tag information. Utilizing sequelize run through the command hub. 
This app provides a CRUD database for products, categories, and tags.

I utilized the module 13 ORM practices to rework to code to this point. A lot of reverse look ups, a lot of refining.
